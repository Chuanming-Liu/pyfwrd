You will need a Fortran 90 compiler to compile the package.

**Run the configure script which will generate the
flags.mk to be used by the different makefiles. It will ask you 
what comiler do you have:
- intel for intel compiler (ifort)
- g95 : GNU fortran 95 compiler 
- pgf for portland compiler
- xlf90 for IBM compiler (e.g. for mac?)
- dec for DEC ALPHA compiler
- sun for SUN
If you need another compiler, we can easely add an new entry in 
the  configure script. 
Warning: if you use g95, the -O level is set to 0 otherwize minosy 
has some problems. I guess it will be fixed with futur versions of g95.
The version I m using now is: "gcc version 4.0.0 20050129 (experimental)  
(g95!) Apr 13 2005"

**Run "make all" or "gmake all" at the top
of the package tree and you should get all the executable files
in bin directory. If you don't ... well you will have to work 
a little bit more than expected or send me an email (try the 
first option first!).

**Some documentations  about these little programs are provided 
in the doc directory. Run "make doc" to creat the pdf file if 
not already there
